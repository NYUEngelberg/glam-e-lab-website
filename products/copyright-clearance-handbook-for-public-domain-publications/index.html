Below, we refer to these as ‘works’. Please note that the handbook only covers copyright clearance in the limited types of objects addressed below, such as paintings, natural specimens, graphic prints, diagrams, maps or photographs. It does not cover copyright clearance for objects like sound recordings, broadcasts or films. These types of objects are less likely to be in the public domain, and therefore less likely to be ‘easy’ places to start your open access programme.</p><p>The design of this handbook is informed by copyright laws of the <b>United Kingdom, United States, and EU Member States</b>, including provisions that: </p><ol><li><p>Contain negative obligations on the use of in-copyright materials (<i>e.g.</i>, for the public and cultural heritage organisations alike);</p></li><li><p>Deny copyright or related right protections to non-original materials generated during an act of reproduction (<i>e.g.</i>, images, data, metadata); and </p></li><li><p>Recognize rights held by third parties, such as personal data or contractual rights. </p></li></ol><p>Accordingly, it helps organisations first confirm if materials lack any rights or restrictions such that the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication</a> can be applied. In many instances, that rights assessment process will identify factors that restrict use of the materials. For our purposes, this means your organisation: (1) might remove those materials from the open access program; (2) identify another machine readable statement to apply in place of CC0; or (3) may be unable to publish those materials to Wikimedia Commons.</p><p><b>This handbook is not intended to be legal advice. You should always contact a qualified professional for legal support.</b></p><h4 class="heading" id="copyright-clearance-at-a-glance">Copyright clearance at a glance</h4><p>Identifying the copyright status of works in your collection is an important part of building your open access programme, often referred to as <b>rights clearance</b>. </p><p>When you clear the rights of a work, you are determining that copyright law does not act as a barrier to its inclusion in your open access program. There are two general strategies for clearing copyright: <b>in bulk or by item</b>. </p><p>Clearing copyright <b>in bulk</b> allows you to use categorical rules to group works in your collection, and then to approve works that meet those rules. Done properly, this will identify works for your open access program much more efficiently than an item-by-item review, with a minimal increase in incorrect copyright status assessments. You will find guidance on this approach in the section on <a href="https://www.glamelab.org/products/copyright-clearance-handbook-for-public-domain-publications/#bulk-copyright-clearance-overview">Bulk Copyright Clearance Overview</a>.</p><p>Clearing copyright <b>by Item</b> involves reviewing each work individually. While this approach may moderately decrease the likelihood of an incorrect copyright evaluation, it can be more time consuming. Moreover, an item-by-item review is unlikely to be necessary for many works in your collection. You will find guidance on this approach in the <a href="https://www.glamelab.org/products/copyright-clearance-handbook-for-public-domain-publications/#item-copyright-clearance-checklists">Item Copyright Clearance Checklists</a>. </p><p>This document contains three checklists. They can be used to evaluate the copyright status of works individually, or categories of works in bulk. If you use them to clear works in bulk, make sure that all the works in the group share the same characteristics relevant for the checklist (you can learn more about this in the <a href="https://www.glamelab.org/products/copyright-clearance-handbook-for-public-domain-publications/#bulk-copyright-clearance-overview">Bulk Clearance Copyright Overview</a>). </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.glamelab.org/products/copyright-clearance-handbook-for-public-domain-publications/#checklist-1-the-underlying-work">Checklist 1</a> provides a step-by-step guide for clearing the <b>underlying work</b>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.glamelab.org/products/copyright-clearance-handbook-for-public-domain-publications/#checklist-2-the-digital-surrogate">Checklist 2</a> provides a step-by-step guide for clearing the <b>digital surrogate</b>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.glamelab.org/products/copyright-clearance-handbook-for-public-domain-publications/#checklist-3-the-metadata">Checklist 3</a> provides a step-by-step guide for clearing the <b>accompanying metadata</b>.</p></li></ul><p>The handbook can be used in conjunction with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ce9ypE6gZDWoCSpWKe42ibb0fl-V1V3WtfQqFIpCwCU/edit?gid=884319758#gid=884319758">Copyright Clearance Log</a> to record the copyright clearance process. </p><h3 class="heading" id="using-public-domain-statements">Using public domain statements</h3><p>Public domain statements indicate that <b>materials are unprotected by copyright and related rights and can be freely used without permission or restriction</b>. It is best practice to use a standardised machine readable statement than to use a descriptive free text statement, like “public domain,” because they ensure that any materials offered under their terms are easy to search for, discover, and use.</p><p>Two standardised sets of machine readable statements are commonly used for cultural heritage materials: </p><ul><li><p><b>Creative Commons licences and tools</b>. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> (CC) provides six licences for marking creative content that offer certain usage rights to the public, while reserving others. They also provide two tools for marking materials as public domain, as discussed below. Both are available in more than 40 languages.</p></li><li><p><b>RightsStatements.org labels</b>. <a href="https://rightsstatements.org/en/">RightsStatements.org</a> labels describe the copyright status of a work, even in instances where that status is unknown. RightsStatements.org labels are intended for use when Creative Commons licences are either not appropriate or cannot be applied. </p></li></ul><p>Both organisations provide machine readable statements for public domain materials. These include:</p><div class="figure"><p class="figure__title"></p><img id="6spPs6oN9mXaxY60rIUULZ" class="figure__image" src="//images.ctfassets.net/1vmrm2atw34v/16glCiTPTmqLRMRpqxORQ9/24a4f9706443fafd552c83bd9f3a943f/cc-zero.png" alt="CC0 icon"><div class="figure__caption"></div></div><p><b>CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication</b> (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>).

This is because CC0 is the most legally-interoperable statement for cross-border users, reassuring these users that the materials can be reused for any purpose, regardless of any copyrights or related rights recognised in the country of use. CC0 also communicates to users that <b>if</b> any copyright or related rights arise in the materials, <b>your organisation has waived those rights and will never enforce them</b>. Lastly, CC0 reassures users that <b>any metadata accompanying the image has also been released as public domain</b>. Taken together, CC0 clearly communicates that the asset as a whole is in the public domain and freely available for anyone to use as they see fit.</p><p>In most cases, you will not have any copyright to waive. This handbook mostly addresses instances where the object itself was created by others and is in the public domain, and no new copyright interest arises in its reproduction due to UK, US, and EU copyright law. Nonetheless, applying CC0 ensures that copyright laws in other countries will not prevent the use of that object, reproduction, or metadata for users within those countries. </p><h4 class="heading" id="when-to-apply-cc0">When to apply CC0</h4><p>Two main criteria must be satisfied to apply CC0:</p><ol><li><p>The <b>object is in the public domain</b> based on its copyright status; and</p></li><li><p>The <b>reproduction of the object is in the public domain</b> based on its copyright status, <b>or</b> any copyright in the reproduction is owned by your organisation, such that <b>your organisation has the power to dedicate the reproduction to the public domain</b>. </p></li></ol><p>This means there are at least two layers of copyright to clear: copyright in the <b>underlying work</b> and copyright in the <b>digitisation</b>. Both layers must be free of copyright to apply CC0. </p><p>For example, for a digitised public domain artwork, this includes:</p><ol><li><p><b>A work of art</b> in the public domain; and</p></li><li><p>A <b>digitization of the artwork</b> made by your organisation (see <i>Figure 1</i>). </p></li></ol><p>If both criteria are satisfied, you can apply CC0.</p><div class="figure"><p class="figure__title"></p><img id="6tSbrPuJqVHwv1es25iJGs" class="figure__image" src="//images.ctfassets.net/1vmrm2atw34v/3iVvXOzynftFC8s3kb1tBv/3a0b786f8051eba23b9dabb9fa9c5bb1/uk-surrogate_layers-02.png" alt="On the left of the image is a circle labelled 'WoA' identified as the 'Work of Art'.

Of course, there are many characteristics that could be used to categorise works in your collection, such as the location where it was produced, the dominant colour of the work, or the year in which it was acquired. As discussed below, only a few of these categories are relevant for a copyright analysis. </p><p>The most important prerequisite for bulk copyright clearance is having accurate metadata about the work. Accurate metadata will make it easier to quickly sort your collection and identify works that fall into specific categories. Without this information, you may still be able to categorise works for bulk clearance. However, it may reduce the overall accuracy of the assessment or result in lower volumes of works that can be cleared according to that category.</p><h3 class="heading" id="identifying-categories">Identifying categories</h3><p>Below you will find examples of categories that support bulk copyright clearance. The specificity or accuracy of details for each category becomes less important as the underlying works in question get older. For example, the year that a creator died is highly relevant to determining the copyright status of a work created in the 20th century. In contrast, simply knowing a work was created before the 19th century will allow you to perform a similarly accurate analysis of its copyright status. Categories useful for bulk copyright clearance might include:</p><ul><li><p>The date of creation (in some cases, you can use the date a work was acquired or entered your collection, <i>e.g.</i>, if the creation date is unknown but the work was acquired in 1870)</p></li><li><p>The date of the creator’s birth</p></li><li><p>The country where the work was created and/or first published</p></li><li><p>Whether the work falls within copyright subject matter (<i>e.g.</i>, a painting, photograph, or sculpture) or is generally excluded from copyright (<i>e.g.,</i> a purely functional object or natural specimen)</p></li><li><p>How the digital version of work was made (<i>e.g.</i>, institutional staff, third parties)</p></li><li><p>Who owns the underlying work (<i>e.g.</i>, public institution, a private individual, Indigenous community)</p></li><li><p>How many intermediary reproductions are included in an image (<i>e.g.</i>, in the case of a digital scan of an analogue photograph of an object, if the analogue photograph was created by institutional staff or third parties)</p></li></ul><h2 class="heading" id="item-copyright-clearance-checklists">Item Copyright Clearance Checklists</h2><p>The checklists in this section will guide you step-by-step through the process of clearing an item in your collection for release under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 1.0 Public Domain Dedication</a>. Once you have cleared copyright in an item, consider whether it forms part of a larger category of works that can all be included in the open access program, such as if there are multiple works by the same author. <b>If you are unable to move to the next step in the process, remove the work from the open access programme for further review</b>.</p><p><a href="https://www.glamelab.org/products/copyright-clearance-handbook-for-public-domain-publications/#checklist-1-the-underlying-work">Checklist 1</a> provides a guide to determining the copyright status of the <b>underlying work</b>. This work may or may not be in your collection. It also might be a building or other publicly accessible 3D work. If that work is itself an<b> image or reproduction of a work</b>, start by <b>first clearing copyright in the work</b> depicted in the image. For instance, for a photograph of a painting held outside your institution, start with the <b>painting, not the photograph</b> of the painting. Use <a href="https://www.glamelab.org/products/copyright-clearance-handbook-for-public-domain-publications/#checklist-1a-united-kingdom-and-eu-member-states">Checklist 1a</a> (UK &amp; EU Member States) or 1b (US) to analyse both the underlying work (the painting) and the reproduction in your collection (the photograph).

The solutions created for those institutions are then integrated into model internal policies and external terms of service that can be adopted by others. The goal of this approach is to use lessons learned from directly representing individual institutions to create self-serve model policies that work “off the shelf” for as many organisations as possible. We supplement these model policies with additional guides and resources to address common challenges.</p><h3 class="heading" id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3><p>Francesca Farmer, Research Fellow Andrea Wallace, Co-Director Michael Weinberg, Co-Director</p><p>The original version of the charts incorporated into this handbook were created by student clinicians Xanthia Hargreaves, Lindsay Harris, Batya Kemper, and Talya Whyte at the NYU Law Technology Law &amp; Policy Clinic.
