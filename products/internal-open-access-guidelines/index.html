That generally means the works are in the public domain - that is, not subject to copyright restrictions - and that your institution controls the copyright of any reproductions or digitizations of the works. It also means that they are not subject to other restrictions, such as those found in donor agreements.</p><p>It is important to remember that works that fall outside of the scope of these policies may still be good candidates for open access. However, in line with the GLAM-E Lab’s “do the easy things first” approach, we generally recommend building a foundation for your open access program with works that are as free of use restrictions as possible. Once that program is up and running, you can explore what it means to include other parts of your collection in the program.</p><h2 class="heading" id="types-of-restrictions">Types of Restrictions</h2><p>Broadly speaking, this policy focuses on two types of restrictions that might make it harder to include a work in your open access program: Intellectual Property (IP) restrictions and non-IP restrictions.</p><p>IP restrictions, which are mostly based in copyright law, will tend to apply similarly across all institutions. This is because they are based on national laws, and many (although certainly not all!) aspects of those national laws have been harmonized internationally. That allows this policy to provide relatively specific guidance when it comes to evaluating IP restrictions.</p><p>Non-IP restrictions tend to be more specific to individual institutions. They can be influenced by the nature of the collection, the institution’s relationship to donors and communities represented in the collection, as well as a number of other factors. As a result, this policy tends to address them at a higher level. You can think of the non-IP restriction sections as invitations to discuss your institution’s specific approach to each issue.</p><h2 class="heading" id="structuring-your-clearance-and-review-process">Structuring Your Clearance and Review Process</h2><p>Your clearance and review process will progress through various stages. As you progress through the process, the work (or group of works) can either move on to the next stage or be pulled out for further review. The IP and non-IP sections of this process are essentially independent, so there is no “right” way to sequence them. For example, some institutions find it easier to start by reviewing whether or not donor agreements would restrict an object’s inclusion in an open access program, and then move on to evaluating the object’s copyright status. Other institutions prefer to reverse the order.</p><p>In structuring this process, the sequence of the IP and non-IP sections is less important than the conversation you have about establishing that order. Is your collection generally free of restrictive donor agreements? It might make sense to remove the few objects that might be restricted from the open access program first, and move on to the copyright analysis for the rest of the collection. Conversely, if researching donor agreements will be complicated, it might make sense to start with your copyright review and then only focus on exploring agreements for works that are in the public domain.</p><p>Similarly, different institutions treat what it means for an object to need “further review” differently. Some institutions treat “further review” as synonymous with “exclude from the open access program.” Others bring a more nuanced approach. For example, they might automatically exclude a work created in 2005 from the open access program because it is still protected by copyright. However, they might dedicate staff time to following up on copyright edge cases, such as older works that were never publicly published.</p><p>Finally, don’t be surprised if some of the elements included below simply do not apply to your collection. This policy is designed to include the most common restrictions that an institution might need to take into account as it creates its open access program. While many of them are likely to be relevant to you, it is entirely possible that after reviewing the restriction category you conclude that it simply does not apply to your collection.</p><h2 class="heading" id="intellectual-property-copyright-and-the-public-domain">Intellectual Property, Copyright, and the Public Domain.</h2><p>This portion of the review is designed to identify two aspects of a work in your collection: First, it examines if the work itself is in the public domain. That would allow you to include it in your open access program without needing to get permission from someone outside of your institution.</p><p>Second, it examines if rights in other parts of the work’s record in your collection - the digital copy of the object, metadata associated with it - are controlled by your institution. If so, your institution will have the ability to license them under open terms.</p><p>Copyright law is designed to control how copies of artistic works and objects are made and distributed. This includes making digital copies of works in your collection, either as photographs or as more complex 3D scans. It also includes making those copies available to the public, including by making them publicly available as part of your open access program.</p><p>The public domain is an important concept when reviewing your collections for inclusion in your open access program. The public domain is made up of works that were never eligible for copyright protection, as well as works with expired copyright protection.</p><p>The public domain is important because anything in it is free of any copyright restrictions. That makes works in the public domain good candidates for your open access program. One way to think of this part of the review is as a search for works in the public domain.</p><p>Although it can be complicated to calculate the copyright status of works made in recent decades, it is safe to assume that works created before 1901 are in the public domain. This rule of thumb can make it easy to identify the works in your collection that are good candidates for open access distribution.</p><h3 class="heading" id="what-copyright-law-protects">What Copyright Law Protects</h3><p>Works that are not protected by copyright are in the public domain. That means it is important to understand exactly what is protected by copyright. Copyright protects original creative work that is fixed in a tangible medium of expression for a limited period of time.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="5W5FW4qoJTSL0ujMGP3Vap"></sup> There are two major limits to that protection: its scope and duration.</p><h4 class="heading" id="scope-what-types-of-things-does-copyright-protect">Scope: What types of things does copyright protect?</h4><p>“Creative” is an important limiting principle to the scope of copyright protection. Copyright only protects the category of works that are considered “creative” under copyright law. Anything that is not creative is categorically ineligible for copyright protection. That means it is in the public domain by default.</p><p>Keep in mind that the law’s definition of creativity does not always align with how the term is used elsewhere. Copyright creativity is mostly grounded in traditional concepts of artistic creativity. Most works of art in a museum’s collection will be the type of work that is “creative” and therefore eligible for copyright protection. In contrast, purely functional objects (even those that result from “creative” engineering”) are not creative in a way that makes them eligible for copyright protection. Similarly, works that do not have a human creator because they are the results of natural processes - fossils, minerals, and specimens of creatures - are not eligible for copyright protection.</p><h4 class="heading" id="duration-how-long-does-copyright-protection-last">Duration: How long does copyright protection last?</h4><p>Even works that are eligible for copyright protection are not protected forever. Once copyright protection expires, the work enters the public domain. One general rule of thumb for 2023 is that the copyright protection for any work created before 1928 has expired. This line advances every year. In 2024 works created before 1929 will enter the public domain, in 2025 works created before 1930 will enter the public domain, and so on.</p><p>There are some exceptions to that general rule. Unpublished works enter the public domain 70 years after the death of the author (if the author is known) or 120 years after the date of creation (if the author is unknown).<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="1MgJRzPnrUzMebAxSnSKAu"></sup> When the publication status of a work is uncertain and the author is not known, the museum can use the 120-year rule to determine if the work belongs to the public domain. As of 2023, works from authors who died before 1953 are part of the public domain, and anonymous works created before 1901 are part of the public domain.</p><p>In the United States, works published between 1926 and March 1, 1989 may also belong to the public domain, depending on when the work was first generally published, whether notice of copyright was attached to the work, and if the copyright protection has expired.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="3jT2hjpJAHrafGTHrGs94Y"></sup> Because the rules for determining copyright status are more complex, your institution should seek legal advice before distributing work in this category for open access. Works published after March 1, 1989 will not enter the public domain until at least December 31, 2047,<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="4Q8dEBFbHIkTrot9ZPbY1a"></sup> unless they are dedicated to the public domain by the copyright owner.</p><h3 class="heading" id="beyond-the-object">Beyond the Object</h3><p>In many cases, an object in a collection is just part of a larger record. Each layer of that record may have a different relationship to copyright protection.</p><p>For example, physical objects in your collection may be protected by multiple layers of copyright: copyright in the object itself (1st layer), copyright in the digitized object (2nd layer), and copyright in the metadata (3rd layer). A painting in an institutional collection may be protected by copyright owned by the original artist (1st layer); a digital image of that painting may be protected by a different copyright owned by the party that took the photograph (2nd layer); and the museum’s description of the painting and its provenance (metadata) may be protected by another copyright owned by the museum (3rd layer).</p><p>The nature of “the object” can add additional layers to this analysis. For some institutions, “the object” in their collection might be a photograph of the painting. In that case, they will have to consider the copyright in the painting itself (0 layer), the copyright in the photograph (1st layer), the copyright in the digitization of that photograph (2nd layer), and copyright in the metadata (3rd layer).</p><p>While this can feel like a lot to keep track of, in many cases the copyrights in the digitization and metadata will be within your institution’s control. That gives you the power to include them in your open access program without having to seek permission elsewhere.</p><p>Furthermore, in the United States, courts have not attached new copyright to precise digital replicas of objects without enhancements (such as 2D or 3D scans),<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="3hXBkOtM1jzRWP43fkrZSq"></sup> so the 2nd layer of copyright does not apply. Unadorned photographs of objects may be eligible for limited copyright protection in some cases, although that protection may not grant the rightsholder a high level of control over how those images are used.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="1bZugQiIa45gdCNBC7S5r0"></sup> However, digitized replicas may be eligible for copyright protection in other countries where the copyright laws are different. The museum generally does not have to investigate this layer of copyright.</p><p>The 3rd layer of copyright applies to metadata, which can include anything that describes a work, from technical information to editorial narratives. Copyright will apply to metadata that are recently created and includes more than just factual information. The extent that there is a copyright protecting the 2nd and 3rd layers of the record, you may be able to use tools like the CC0 public domain dedication to include them in your open access program.</p><h3 class="heading" id="special-topics">Special Topics</h3><p>Understanding the scope and duration of copyright protection will help you identify public domain works in your collection that may be good candidates for an open access program. While defining both of those terms can be straightforward in many cases, our work with individual institutions has helped us to identify edge cases where additional detail can be helpful. This section explores those cases.</p><p>The section discusses situations involving works in your collection and reproductions of works in your collection. This distinction may take different forms for different collections. For example, one institution might have a vase in its collection (the object), and take a photograph of that vase as part of its documentation (the reproduction). A second institution may have a photograph of the vase as the work in its collection (the object), and may digitize that.</p><h4 class="heading" id="photographs-of-architectural-works">Photographs of Architectural Works</h4><p>There are special provisions of the U.S. Copyright Act that allows architectural works to be photographed freely if they are publicly available. This provision defines “architectural work” broadly to include the building as well as architectural plans and drawings.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="56JjeoiBtTZ0EXIbjIPyok"></sup> If the work is an architectural work that is ordinarily visible from a public place, then photographs of the work are permissible, regardless of the copyright status of the work.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="3BxvFAJqvWjR2Irjco1E2z"></sup> Any building that is visible from a street, plaza, or other public place would qualify.</p><h4 class="heading" id="country-of-publication">Country of Publication</h4><p>If the work was first published outside of the United States, and it was not published in the United States within 30 days of the first publishing, it is an international work.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="3Qw6mASTnrhUtFsrXQKikc"></sup>Copyright Office, _[Circular 38B: Copyright Restoration](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38b.pdf)_ Determining the copyright status of this work in the United States requires understanding the copyright status of the work in its country of origin. That may require additional research if the work was published after 1928.</p><h3 class="heading" id="reproductions-work-made-for-hire">Reproductions - Work Made for Hire</h3><p>Your institution owns any copyrights in reproductions of works in your collection made by employees because they are “works made for hire.” If the reproductions were made by outside contractors or other third parties, you may need to see if the contract with that person transfers the copyright to your institution.</p><h2 class="heading" id="non-intellectual-property-based-restrictions">Non-Intellectual Property-Based Restrictions</h2><p>In addition to copyright restrictions, other legal and non-legal considerations may prevent the museum from giving open access to the work.</p><h3 class="heading" id="contractual-restrictions">Contractual Restrictions</h3><p>Your institution may have acquired some works under contractual restrictions that would limit the museum’s ability to distribute digitized copies of the work for open access. Some of the more common restrictions include prohibition to use the work commercially, requirement to obtain the creator/donor’s permission to reproduce the work, or limitation on how the work may be changed. You should confirm if there are contractual restrictions before providing open access to the work.</p><h3 class="heading" id="privacy">Privacy</h3><ul><li><p>Your institution should avoid including works in an open access program if they: contain private personal information, such as identification numbers, bank information, medical or health records, or other privileged or confidential information.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="dY8k5WOa5RPCSirsGxDm5"></sup></p></li><li><p>may intrude upon a person’s seclusion, disclose private facts, paint someone in false light, or appropriate someone’s name, voice, or likeness.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="3teIr6wBi6IjfNSs8B4CAR"></sup></p></li></ul><p>When a work may potentially fall into this category, you should seek legal advice before distributing such work on open access terms.</p><h3 class="heading" id="other-legal-and-ethical-restrictions">Other Legal and Ethical Restrictions</h3><p>Some works relate to objects that are sacred to certain cultures (i.e. objects subject to NAGPRA<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="2Q229F3n3Q0P28vA827hmJ"></sup> in the United States) and should not be distributed on open access terms without the permission of the affiliated cultures. If the museum has internal guidelines for the reproduction of this category of work, the museum should consult those guidelines. If providing open access to a work may lead to harm or exploitation of certain cultures, the museum should engage the relevant cultural communities to determine if the museum can provide public access to such work in a responsible way.<sup tabindex="3" class="footnote" id="51J8mB38PagzGvfPtiWu76"></sup></p><p>This portion of the review is also an opportunity to consider if Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels might be a good fit for your open access program.
