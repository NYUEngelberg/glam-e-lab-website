Heritage organisations are trusted stewards of important records, natural specimens, artistic creations, memories and stories while also pursuing new research and discoveries. </p><p>Open licensing allows heritage organisations to fulfil those roles by making the UK’s rich natural and cultural heritage more accessible and available. When materials are openly licensed, anyone can use them for any legal purpose without permission. The National Lottery Heritage Fund, and many other funding organisations, use open licences to release data, collections and other materials for public reuse, unless there is a specific (legal, technical or ethical) reason not to.</p><p>This briefing helps heritage organisations understand the ways that open licensing will work for their organisation and mission-driven activities by covering:</p><ul><li><p><b>what open licensing is</b> and when it can be used</p></li><li><p><b>the benefits, opportunities and risks</b> of open licensing</p></li><li><p><b>how open licensing supports the digital transformation</b> of the heritage sector</p></li><li><p><b>strategic areas of investment and focus</b> in open licensing </p></li><li><p><b>open licensing currently in use </b>across the UK heritage sector and internationally</p></li><li><p><b>model policies, supporting resources and other tools</b> for robust open policies</p></li></ul><h3 class="heading" id="what-is-copyright-and-why-does-it-matter-for-heritage-organisations">What is copyright and why does it matter for heritage organisations?</h3><p>Copyright is an intellectual property right that regulates the use of creative materials including literary and artistic works, sound recordings, broadcasts, research datasets and computer programs. </p><ul><li><p>The owner of the copyright can allow, condition or prohibit use of the creative materials.</p></li><li><p>Copyright lasts a long time.

For example, open licensing: </p><ul><li><p><b>Supports your organisation’s mission. </b>Heritage organisations help people and society understand the world and advance our knowledge. Making it easy for anyone, including other heritage organisations, to engage with your materials is a cornerstone of that mission-led work.</p></li><li><p><b>Connects your organisation with more communities.</b> It can be hard to understand who is not engaging with your materials until you remove the barriers for doing so. Open licensing allows you to reach communities you previously have been unable to reach and to discover new communities you did not realise were eager to explore and use your collections.</p></li><li><p><b>Supports preservation</b>. Openly-licensed, high-quality research, collections and other materials can be distributed, archived, and accessed from multiple sites. This increases their preservation resiliency. Materials can be secured more cost effectively for smaller organisations and can benefit from the maintenance and care of open communities and volunteers.</p></li><li><p><b>Contributes to the economy. </b>Open licensing enables innovation in AI, machine learning, computer vision and computational research, and provides important materials to stimulate the creative industries.</p></li><li><p><b>Raises your organisation’s profile</b>. Open licensing allows your research, collections or other materials to reach audiences on a wide range of platforms, from Wikipedia to television and movies, and to cutting-edge web and phone applications. Many organisations see large increases in web traffic to their websites and interactions on social media, citations and direct inquiries after deploying open licensing.</p></li><li><p><b>Can drive new revenue and business models. </b>Open licensing has proven to be a source of new revenue for many organisations, including partnerships to digitise additional works, brand licensing, and consultations about newly-prominent materials.</p></li><li><p><b>Can create cost savings and help reprioritise your resources in support of organisational goals.</b> Limiting access to materials is expensive. The costs of operating a licensing programme often exceed associated revenues when accounting for the staffing, workflows, and inefficiencies required to administer services and fulfil requests. The digital infrastructures required to gate and toll access can be much more expensive than making those materials freely available for self-service delivery. </p></li><li><p><b>Creates new ways of working</b>. By removing barriers and friction around use, open licensing greatly increases the velocity of collaboration. This opens the door to entirely new ways of working, both within your organisation and with external partners. </p></li><li><p><b>Supports digital literacy</b>. Your openly licensed materials act as new entry points for individuals to build their digital literacy, including individuals in your organisation. They can explore your materials and connect them with other openly licensed materials to better understand their digital capabilities, and to use them as building blocks for new projects.</p></li></ul><h4 class="heading" id="focus-on-open-licensing-uptake-in-uk-heritage">Focus on: open licensing uptake in UK heritage</h4><ul><li><p>In the UK, around 100 heritage organisations have released digital collections under open licences and public domain tools.

Open licensing can align your organisation’s policies with the requirements of many funders and establish standardised workflows for heritage management across your organisation. </p><p>Your organisation can rely on existing, standard licences in your open policy:</p><ul><li><p>Use the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"><b>CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication</b></a> for <b>digital reproductions of public domain works</b>, such as photographs and scans. Creative Commons recommends CC0 as the most appropriate tool for these images. While UK law does not grant a new copyright, CC0 reassures users in other jurisdictions that the images can be freely used without risk of infringement.</p></li><li><p>Use the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"><b>CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication</b></a> for <b>metadata and code</b> created during the digitization process. This facilitates the use of this information for a wide range of purposes.</p></li><li><p>Use the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><b>CC BY 4.0 (Attribution) Licence</b></a> for <b>new original content</b> created during the course of the project such as infographics or articles. This allows everyone to share and adapt the materials for any purpose, even commercially, while giving credit to your organisation.</p></li></ul><p>Adopting a standard, effective open licensing structure creates a future-proof policy for your organisation. This structure will reduce the amount of legacy data, rights and licensing services you are required to maintain, reducing the resources required to update and upgrade systems. </p><p>Organisations should not use contract law to replicate the permission-based control and fee models of copyright licensing services. An example includes restricting the use of open and public domain materials with terms and conditions that require users to pay fees based on the reuse purpose. Such terms run counter to the goals of open movements and are prohibited by The Heritage Fund’s policy.</p><h3 class="heading" id="building-organisational-sustainability-and-resilience-through-open-programming">Building organisational sustainability and resilience through open programming</h3><p>Open licensing programmes can support organisational sustainability by:</p><ul><li><p>reducing legal costs and reliance on external advice</p></li><li><p>reducing administration costs related to licensing services</p></li><li><p>reducing long-term costs related to legacy data and policy updates</p></li><li><p>helping organisations support inclusion, access and participation through your digital strategy and public mission </p></li><li><p>helping organisations gain relevance as materials are circulated and reused </p></li><li><p>expanding user bases and generating new knowledge around materials</p></li><li><p>attracting more diverse income sources through open access and new business models</p></li></ul><h3 class="heading" id="legal-and-ethical-limits-to-open-licensing">Legal and ethical limits to open licensing</h3><p>While open policies can be powerful tools to achieve many of your organisation’s goals, not all works are suitable for open licensing. Certain rights may arise in materials and merit additional consideration. While these rights are not incompatible with open licensing, all rights holders must give permission to apply an open licence to materials. </p><ul><li><p><b>Performers&#39; rights</b> can arise in films or sound recordings of a person&#39;s speech or movement and initially belong to the person featured.</p></li><li><p><b>Database rights</b> are protected under copyright and related rights and initially belong to the maker or producer of the materials.</p></li><li><p><b>Contractual rights</b> in agreements among creators, producers, employers and distributors can further limit the reuse of materials. Contributors or donors may also limit reuse through contracts.</p></li><li><p><b>Privacy and data rights</b> can arise in materials that identify a living person and will belong to the persons who are identifiable.</p></li></ul><p>Public domain works in your collection will often, although not always, lack these types of rights because they typically expire before or with the copyright protection. </p><p>Open licences cannot be retracted once they have been applied to a work. However, it is possible to remove data from your public platforms, and sometimes possible to update data held elsewhere. Developing a strategy to remove or correct data when creating your open access program will help you accommodate emerging or evolving legal, technical, and ethical concerns. </p><h3 class="heading" id="exceptions-to-open-licensing">Exceptions to open licensing</h3><p>Even when materials are in the public domain, some tend to raise other types of concerns such as:</p><ul><li><p>images of, or contributions by, children, young people, and other vulnerable populations</p></li><li><p>endangered species or migration data that could expose those species to increased interference from humans</p></li><li><p>ancestral remains, spiritual works, or funerary objects</p></li><li><p>artefacts, knowledge or memories of cultural significance to communities of origin</p></li><li><p>materials with sensitive information or personal data</p></li></ul><p>As such, it is important to work with your staff to identify materials that due to their status and sensitivity are not suitable for open licences. </p><h3 class="heading" id="open-licensing-and-responsible-stewardship">Open licensing and responsible stewardship</h3><p>Open licensing can help you think critically about what data, collections and images are appropriate for access or reuse. The Open Data Institute’s report on <a href="https://theodi.cdn.ngo/media/documents/Responsible-data-stewardship.pdf">responsible data stewardship</a> sets out legal and ethical principles to follow in respecting privacy, ensuring security and transparency, considering societal impact, and upholding integrity while promoting trust and accountability in data practices. </p><p>Notices with additional information about objects are powerful, inclusive complements to your open policy. They can be used to provide cultural and relevant contextual insights about the people, knowledge, practices, and objects represented in the collection, as well as the existence of – and reasons for – errors and inaccuracies. Notices can open up communications and serve as invitations to communities of origin to contact your organisation to become more involved in your collections. They can be included as metadata in your open records, and displayed alongside objects in your open collection. If you create your own notices, the notices themselves can be openly licensed.</p><h2 class="heading" id="international-examples-of-organisations-benefiting-from-open-licensing">International examples of organisations benefiting from Open Licensing</h2><p>Heritage organisations around the world have published their materials using open licences and public domain tools, enabling more people’s heritage to be recognised.
